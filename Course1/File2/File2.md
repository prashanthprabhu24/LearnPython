# How Programs work in computers.:desktop_computer:
> A computer program is a collection of instruction that can be executed by the computer to perform a specific task . (From Wikipedia)<br/>
* Computers are fully functioning with the large number of diffrent programs.<br/>
* Every program has its own specific task to do. For example, Music player is a application program that plays the music and Browser is an application program that helps to browse over internet . 
* There are two kinds of Computer Program : 
  1. Application Program (AKA Application Software)
  1. System Program (AKA System Software)<br/>
  
1. **Application Program** : <br/>
 * Application Program is a executable program which is not the part of system and installed by user. <br/>
 * These application (App) can be WordProcess, Web Browsers, Photo/Video Editors, Spread Sheet, Media Player File viewer, Games, etc. <br/>
 * Everything that being installed seperatly from internet or anyother source is an application software / App .<br/><br/>
2. **System Program** : <br/>
 * It is a software designed to provide a platform for other softwares. <br/>
 * System softwares allows Application softwares to run on computers. <br/>
 * Operarting System(OS) is an System Software. <br/>
 * OS is the only program that has access to control all hardware parts in the computers and all Application software asks OS permission to get its access . <br/><br/>

###### Play of System and Application Software : <br/>
* Consider an Example : Let System Software/ Operating System be "Microsoft Windows" and Let Application Software be "Music Player".<br/>
* And Disc/Rom , RAM, CPU, Speaker, etc are Hardware components.<br/>
* Now Consider Music Player does these operation on hardwares : <br/>
  1. Operating system(OS) gets the intrupt to open Music player.
  1. OS locates the Music player location in the Disc.
  1. OS Loads the Music player executable code from Hard Disc/ROM to RAM.
  1. OS Again loads the Music player program from RAM to CPU.
  1. CPU executes the Music player Code and OS allocates required resourse needed to it.
  1. Music Files are accessed from Hard disc/ROM.
  1. Feeds to current Music file to ROM.
  1. Running Music player Gets access to Speaker and plays the Song.
* Every files has its own extention , so the OS can recognize what the file is used for. Eg : MP3 music file has '.mp3' as extention . Text file has '.txt' as extention. et al.
* Even all executable application software as '.exe' as extention. 
* When we learn to write a any programs , our main aim is to make it as executable code and make it run like an Application software. So it can run on any computers.
