# How Computers works with programs 
### What are Computers 
> Computers is a machine that are instructed to do some task via computer programming and it stores information(data) and outputs information(data) (by Wikipedia 2020)

The main reason for manufacturing computers in early 19's is to make any tasks faster than humans with no (or minimum) error.

The Computers are made of collection of small devices like drivers , circuits , registers , logic gates , transitors etc . All these devices takes only 1's and 0's as inputs.

The only language the computers know are binary numbers ( 0's and 1's ). 

And humans have their own language like english , spanish etc . and we may need to learn the binary numbers to talk to computers ? 

Here is a scenario : A person-A knows only "english" and Person-B knows only "Spanish". Person-A wants to ask the way to Airport to someone and he sees no one around except Person-B . How Could he possibly communicate with him ? 
















For example : Consider a device called printer that prints the documents/images . How to say the printer (that knows only 0's and 1's) to print something ? 












Early computers does only few numerical operations like Add, Subtract. Only using 0's and 1's it was possible to add , subtract any kind of numbers inculing decimal numbers.
Binary number system is a number expressed using only 0 (zero) and 1 (one) . it also said as base-2 numerical system .
