### How Computers works with programs 
##### What are Computers 
> Computers is a machine that are instructed to do some task via computer programming and it stores information(data) and outputs information(data) (by Wikipedia 2020)

* The main reason for manufacturing computers in early 19's is to make any tasks faster than humans with no (or minimum) error.<br/>
* The Computers are made of collection of small devices like drivers , circuits , registers , logic gates , transitors etc .<br/> 
* All these devices takes only 1's and 0's as inputs.<br/>
* The only language the computers know are binary numbers ( 0's and 1's ). Which is difficult for humans to learn <br/>
* And humans have their own language like english , spanish etc . and we may need to learn the binary numbers to talk to computers ? <br/>
* **Here is a scenario :** A *Person-A* knows only *"English"* and *Person-B* knows only *"Spanish"*. <br/>
Person-A wants to ask the way to Airport to someone and he sees no one around except Person-B . <br/>
How Could he possibly communicate with him ? <br/>

<br/>

* Here , Person-A doesn't understand what Person-B saying and Person-B doesn't understand what Person-A saying. <br/>
* If Person-A needs to communicate with Person-B , the he needs someone who knows both "English" and "Spanish". <br/>
* The Man , who is translator will get the task question that Person-B needs to do in "English" and he convert that to "Spanish" , then deliver it to Person-B. <br/>
###### Computer language : 0's and 1's is also known as Machine Language <br/>
* For computer example : Consider a device called printer that prints the documents/images . How to say the printer through computer (that knows only 0's and 1's) to print something ? <br/>

* Here we use a translator called **Assembler**. <br/>
* We use a language little bit similar to english on assembler and assembler converts it to machine language and send it to computer(CPU perticularly).<br/>

Early computers does only few numerical operations like Add, Subtract. Only using 0's and 1's it was possible to add , subtract any kind of numbers inculing decimal numbers.
Binary number system is a number expressed using only 0 (zero) and 1 (one) . it also said as base-2 numerical system .
