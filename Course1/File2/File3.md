# Data in Computer : 
> Any Data in computer is computed and stored in the form of binary Symbols/Digits (ie. 1's and 0's)
* Data is a peice of Information. 
* Everything is a data , Eg: Person Name, Phone Number, Time of the meeting, Name of the File, Sets of pull up's today, Songs, Alphabets, Numbers, Symbols.

Data
$ Data in computer hardware.
$ Representation of data in computer.
$ Input and Output Data.
$ Input and output Devices.
$ How data is stored and computed
-->
* In Computer, there are primarily two ways data is used: 
    1. Input Data.
    2. Output Data.
1. __Input Data :__
    * Any Data that used by computer (given as input) is called input data
    * Eg :  1. Voice/Songs/Music from microphone or files to computer processing.
            2. Alphabets,Numbers, Symbols, Event keys from Keybord and Mouse.
          
2. __Output Data :__
    * Any Data the Comes out of the computer is called Output Data.
    * Eg : 1. Songs, voice, Music To loudspeaker.
           2. Alphabets, Numbers, Symbols To Display screen.
    
###### How Data is stored in Computers :
* Any kind of Data is completly stored as series of Binary numbers.
* What are the Data we have in real world ? : 
    1. Numbers {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
    2. Letters {A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z,a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z}
    3. Symbols {!, @, #, $, %, ^ , &, * , (, ), _, -, +, =, \, <, >, :, ;, {, }, etc }
    4. Images
    5. Audio
    6. Video , etc.
    We will discuss each and how it stored as binary numbers in computers.<br/>
* __Numbers :__
    * Any kind of Whole Numbers can be stored in computer memeory by converting it into Binary numbers.
    * Intergers to Binary Conversion : Converting a Interger numbers into Binary numbers .
    > Eg : <br/>
        (int)  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  = (binary) . '=' indicates 'Equivalence' <br/>
         24    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    = 11000 <br/>
       2022    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  = 11111100110 <br/>
      18.63    &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; = 10010.101 <br/>
    3.14159  &nbsp;  = 11.001001 <br/>
    * Even Negative Numbers can be Converted into Binary.
    * This conversion is also known as Decimal to Binary conversion.
    * Its possible to Convert Binary Back to Decimal and its Known as Binary to decimal Conversion.
    * The Numbers is converted into Decimal is stored. and it retrieved back to Decimal Numbers.<br/>

* __Letters and Symbols :__
    * Any English Alphabets / Special symbols/greek symbols/Other languages can be converted into Binary.
    * ASCII : American Standard Code for Information Interchange. This converts alphabets/symbols into decimal numbers and then to binary.
    > Eg : <br/>
        ASCII code of "A" is 65
    * Google ASCII Table to refer ASCII code for all letters and symbols.<br/>

* __Images :__ 
    * Images are the pictures , these pictures are made up of matrix of pixels.
    * Pixel is a digital image length and is uses to measure the quality of images and camera's.
    > (Redmi Note 7 Pro smart phone has 48Mp(48 mega pixel) camera)<br/>

    * The person in the above pic is 16th U.S President , Abraham Lincoln. 
    * The Computer takes the Image and  makes a matrix of pixel values and stores the values in the same sequence in binary form.
    

* __Audio :__ <br/>
* __Video :__ <br/>
